This is my submission for the first assignment in the course Web Dev please do not take the content of the site too seriously.

Note:
it seems that the Facebook like button is treated as a tracking violation (at least by Firefox) and hence
it would not be visible if tracking protection is enabled, to disable on Firefox go to about:config and turn privacy.trackingprotection.enabled off

It seems that chromium browsers do not cause any issues with this by default but I'm uncertain as I use Firefox.
